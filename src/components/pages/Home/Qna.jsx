        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>
            By definition digital marketing (aka online marketing) promotes a
            client’s brand, products and services via the internet or other
            digital channels. A digital marketing campaign is typically
            delivered via an electronic device, such as computer, tablet, phone
            or other medium, and leverages one or more channels, such as social
            media, search engines, websites, email and others, as chosen by the
            digital marketer based on your goals, to raise brand awareness
            amongst potential and current customers.

            A digital marketer finds creative solutions to drive brand awareness
            and lead generation via free or paid digital channels, including
            email, search engines, social media, the company’s website and blog.
            The exact mix will depend on the client’s specific goals. The
            digital marketer focuses on relevant KPIs (key performance
            indicators) to measure performance and maximize revenue potential.
            Some companies have in-house digital marketers whilst others prefer
            to outsource, seeking different skills in agencies or freelancers,
            depending on their channel mix.

          <p>
            A well-planned and executed digital marketing campaign will target
            the right prospects for your products or services at the right time,
            which means they are more likely to buy or book what you offer. It’s
            more flexible, efficient, and cost-effective than many traditional
            marketing methods and it allows you to compete with the big guns in
            your industry even if you are only a small player. It also provides
            detailed analytics so you can measure everything from the number of
            visitors, to how long they spent on your page, whether or not they
            made a sale and so much more, including cost per click and ROI
            (return on investment)

            You’ll hear a lot of jargon and sometimes a lot of acronyms
            associated with digital marketing. The most common types of digital
            marketing include Social Media Management (SMM), Search Engine
            Optimization (SEO), Search Engine Marketing (SEM), Pay-per-Click
            (PPC) Marketing, Email Marketing, Website Design and Maintenance,
            Content Marketing and Sponsored Content, Affiliate Marketing, Native
            Advertising, Inbound Marketing, and Online PR. A good digital
            marketer will recommend the best mix for your business based on your
            specific goals.

            Digital marketing is a must for every business. If you need
            customers (and who doesn’t?), you need to do online marketing. One
            of its key benefits is that it provides a cost-effective way to
            reach a huge audience while simultaneously targeting a specific
            group within that audience (reach and accuracy). It also allows you
            to personalize the delivery channel and message to communicate more
            quickly and effectively with your customers for short- and long-term
            relationship building.
